# Introduction to OOP in Java

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into objects containing data and behavior. Java is a fully object-oriented language.

## Key OOP Principles
- **Objects and Classes**: Objects are instances of classes, which define their structure.
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;
    void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
    }
}
```

- **Instance and Static Members**: Instance variables belong to an object, while static members belong to a class.
```java
class Example {
    static int count;
    int instanceVar;
}
```

## Benefits of OOP
- Code reusability
- Modularity
- Maintainability
- Scalability

## Conclusion
Understanding OOP is fundamental in Java programming. Mastering these concepts will help in developing efficient applications.
