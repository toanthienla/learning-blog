# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content on the web using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph in HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all the content.
